# NotAmint
## Tic Tac Toe with AI
### Instructions to run (currently)
* Open your browser of choice
* Open the console (F12 in most Windows browsers | Option-Cmd-J for Mac)
* Copy and Paste the contents of TTT_clean into the console and run (enter or Run button)
* If the code does nothing it is most likely because I removed the call to `the_game()` (add `the_game();` to the end of the copied code to run)
* When inputting coordinates for Row and Column start at 0 (upper-left would be 0,0. lower-left would be 0,2)
`[0,0][0,1][0,2]`
`[1,0][1,1][1,2]`
`[2,0][2,1][2,2]`


### This is a work in progress and should gain complexity and functionality constantly
